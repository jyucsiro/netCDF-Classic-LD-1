Each variable within a netCDF file that is defined with respect to one or more dimensions shall be described by a statement:

 `+<$entity> <https://www.opengis.net/def/binary-array-ld/shape> ($d0 $d1 $d2) .+`

where `$dn` is an integer, taken from the defined dimension size in the netCDF file and the count of the number of values is the dimensionality of the variable.

Where a variable is defined with respect to a single dimension, the statements


 `+<$entity> <https://www.opengis.net/def/binary-array-ld/shape> ($d0) .+`

and

 `+<$entity> <https://www.opengis.net/def/binary-array-ld/shape> $d0 .+`

shall be interpreted as semantically equivalent.
