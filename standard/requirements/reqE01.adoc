An attribute may be declared by a metadata standard as a variable reference attribute.

In order to do this, the attribute shall declare itself in a resolveable RDF graph and include the statement:

 `+<{attribute}> rdfs:range <https://www.opengis.net/def/binary-array-ld/Subject> .+`

It is also permissable to provide an rdfs:range statement targeting another resource and for that resource to declare that it is an rdfs:subClassOf bald:Subject, for example:

 `+<{attribute}> rdfs:range <{AClass}> .+`

 `+<{AClass}> rdfs:subClassOf <https://www.opengis.net/def/binary-array-ld/Subject> .+`
